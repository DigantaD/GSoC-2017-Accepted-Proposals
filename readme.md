Project Description: PDF Generation, Memory Safety and Anonymous Safety for the Mathematical software, SCILAB

Title : PDF Generation, Memory Safety and Anonymous Safety for the Mathematical software, SCILAB


Abstract : a) PDF Generation​ : I want to work on this project because most of the big sector 
organisations and even teaching institutes want their projects and assignments to be 
submitted in PDF files. So, using JAVA we can create a tool which while saving a SCILAB file, 
will ask which format we want it to be saved or will give .pdf as an option in the extensions 
list. We can even provide a small button on the toolbar saying 'Convert to PDF while saving'. 
Since, I am proficient with JAVA, I can take responsibility of the coding part under the 
guidance of a mentor who can help me with the algorithm. 

b) Memory Safety​ : Bug Fixes are the best way to keep a software or open source platform 
available to an end-user. So, we can create a link between the Coverity page and the SCILAB 
platform's home page. As soon as anyone reports a bug on Coverity, it gets linked to the 
SCILAB page and is shown under a 'Recent Bugs' column. The bug fixers will then spend 
their time to fix the bug and update the software/package.

c) Anonymous Usage Tracking​ : The best use of developing this feature will be that 
whenever one opens SCILAB, he will get a link to the examples and solutions to the most 
used features on the platform so that he doesn't have to hover around on the Internet. We 
have to create the same technology which Google Analytics uses whenever we search in 
any online shopping portal so that the next time we search, they give us the options of 
probable products we want to use. I personally am very eager to work on this as this 
includes the usage of JAVA programming which I am adept at.
